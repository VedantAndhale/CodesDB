Bug fixing 2
The programmer here is trying to convert the string "hello" to "HELLO" by
using the upper() method:

    greeting = "hello"
    print(upper(greeting))

However, the program returns an error.
Can you help fix the code, so it prints out HELLO?
it is method so fix is greeting.upper()

Bug fixing 3
A programmer wrote the following program:
countries = []
while True:
    country = input("Enter the country: ")
    countries.append(country)
print(countries)

print(countries) should be inside while loop

Bug fixing 1
Supposedly, the following program should:
1. Prompt the user to input an index (e.g., 0, 1, or 2).
2. Print out the item with that index.
However, there is a bug with the program which you should try to fix.
    menu = ["pasta", "pizza", "salad"]
    user_choice = input("Enter the index of the item: ")
    message = f"You chose {menu[user_choice]}."
    print(message)
convert str to int user_choice

Bug fixing 2
 Here is another piece of buggy code:
    menu = ["pasta", "pizza", "salad"]
    for i, j in enumerate[menu]:
        print(f"{i}.{j}")
Fix the code, so it prints out the output below:
    0.pasta
    1.pizza
    2.salad
change brackets to ()

Bug fixing 3
Here is another piece of code that contains a bug:
    menu = ["pasta", "pizza", "salad"]
    for i, j in enumerate(menu):
        print("f{i}.{j}")
The expected output is this:
    0.pasta
    1.pizza
    2.salad
Fix the bug so the program prints out the above output.
f should be outside ""
